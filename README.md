# ðŸš€ Gravitational Slingshot Effect Simulation ðŸŒŒ

Ever wondered how spacecraft use gravity to slingshot across space? This project simulates that effect using Python and **Pygame**!

### What is it?
This simulation lets you create spacecraft and observe how they interact with a planetâ€™s gravity. The closer they get, the faster they go, thanks to the **gravitational slingshot effect**!

### ðŸ”¥ Features:
- **Gravitational Physics**: Watch how spacecraft are pulled and sped up by the planet.
- **Create Spacecraft**: Click to spawn a spacecraft and set its velocity.
- **Space Simulation**: Explore gravity and motion in action.

### ðŸ’¡ How Does It Work?
The spacecraft is influenced by the planet's gravity based on **Newtonâ€™s Law of Gravitation**:

\[
F = \frac{{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}}{{r^2}}
\]

Where:
- \( F \) is the gravitational force (the "pull" between the planet and the spacecraft).
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant.
- \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses of the planet and spacecraft.
- \( r \) is the distance between them.

As the spacecraft gets closer to the planet, the force becomes stronger, making it accelerate and increase speed. ðŸŒ
