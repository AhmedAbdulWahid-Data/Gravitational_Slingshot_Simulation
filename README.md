# 🚀 Gravitational Slingshot Effect Simulation 🌌

Ever wondered how spacecraft use gravity to slingshot across space? This project simulates that mind-blowing effect using Python and **Pygame**! 🌍✨

### What is it?
This simulation allows you to create your own spacecraft and see how they interact with the massive planet at the center. The spacecraft will speed up as they get close to the planet, thanks to gravity. It's like playing a space game, but with **real physics**! 🌠

### 🔥 Features:
- **Gravitational Physics**: Watch how your spacecraft’s path changes as it is influenced by gravity.
- **Create Spacecraft**: Click to spawn a spaceship, adjust its velocity, and see it go zooming off!
- **Space Simulation**: Planet? Check! Spaceships? Check! Gravity? Oh yes! 🚀

### 💡 How Does It Work?
The spacecraft are affected by the gravitational force of the planet using **Newton’s law of gravitation**. This formula is like the magic behind the scenes:

\[
F = \frac{{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}}{{r^2}}
\]

Where:
- \( F \) is the gravitational force (how hard the planet pulls the spaceship).
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant (space's special number for pulling things together).
- \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses of the planet and the spacecraft.
- \( r \) is the distance between them.

As the spacecraft gets closer to the planet, the force increases and the ship speeds up. Get ready for a cosmic ride! 🌌💨
